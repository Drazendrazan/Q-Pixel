A NoPixel Re-Creation.


Q-Pixel-1.0[3.5]​
A NoPixel Clone Server.
​
INFO​
This is a effort between me and one other dev to re-create NoPixel to a 1:1 likeness,
We believe we are closest clone to a NoPixel 3.5 Server out there.

This server is not free BUT subscription based, This means you pay a small fee of $25 weekely or $100 monthly to use this server,
With that you also get automatic updates and new features as and when they get pushed to the live repo!

A handful of it's resources encrypted to keep the subscription side valid and also deter re-sellers and leakers from posting this everywhere!
So this said if you get offered this server and it isnt from our tebex store YOU ARE NOT GETTING THIS SERVER AS IT ISNT POSSIBLE DUE TO TEBEX/FIVEM ESCROW!

See video below to take a look at what the server has to offer

!Side note this has nothing to do with my previous post and is a completly differnt server!

Want to see more? Join the discord below where you will find more information on pricing and the server!​
